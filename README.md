numpy-notes
===========

A collection of notes about NumPy.

This is not a really blog, nor a tutorial.  It is a place to record bits and
pieces of information about NumPy as I figure them out.  Initially the content
level and organization will be fairly random.  It will certainly be incomplete,
and there is a nonzero chance that parts of it may be wrong.  Also, these notes
will likely discuss NumPy implementation details that are not part of the
public API and may change in the future.
